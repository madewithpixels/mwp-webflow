# madewithpixels website — Status
**Stage:** Building on staging (madewithpixels-dev.webflow.io). Desktop home page close to done; phone and tablet layouts, the estimate page and launch prep still to do. Not live: madewithpixels.co.uk still serves the old site.
**Last updated:** 24 October 2026 — Claude (Cowork)
**Reviewed at commit:** fe844e6, the commit this snapshot was checked against (the four docs, AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md are new and not yet committed)
**Next action:** Phase 1: put the site's custom code in this repo (R-029), then the desktop polish (Phase 2).
**Needs Michael:**
- Commit the new docs in this folder (an agent can't commit here from the shared shell yet; see Handoff).

## 24 October 2026 — Claude (Cowork) — New task: clickable wall
**Changed**
- Your new task "Clickable testi-wall" is roadmap item R-074, at the end of the desktop polish (Phase 2). Read as the folio wall, where the portfolio images are (inferred — confirm).
- Every roadmap item now names its task in your boss list, so new and ticked tasks can be matched.

**Checked how:** all 74 items matched a task by its exact wording. Evidence: n/a (documents).

## 24 October 2026 — Claude (Cowork) — Order agreed
**Changed**
- SmashBurger's update (R-030) moved to a new last phase: finish this site as far as possible, then SmashBurger, then bring its release in (D-021).
- Scripts move to jsDelivr at launch prep, not now (D-003, accepted).
- The four suggestions (R-045, R-052, R-059, R-063) agreed by Michael and added to his boss list, under Responsive layouts and Launch prep.

**Checked how:** the four new tasks read back from boss's database. Evidence: n/a (documents).

## 24 October 2026 — Claude (Cowork) — Retrofit baseline
**What this is:** the first record for the site in the boss four-doc structure, built from your task list in boss, the session notes in the "MWP Website 2026" Claude project, and the site as it stands.

**Changed**
- New: SCOPE.md, ROADMAP.md (73 items), DECISIONS.md (20 decisions), this STATUS.md, AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md.
- ROADMAP: every task in your "madewithpixels Website" list is an item with your wording. 28 ticked tasks are recorded as built and accepted on the date you ticked them. 40 open tasks are in a suggested order in six phases (the jsDelivr task is split into two steps), plus 4 suggestions that weren't on your list, each marked "Suggested — not on your list".
- Your list in boss is untouched. Nothing in Webflow was changed.
- **Time logged, at your request:** 9 entries on "Finish MWP site" in boss, one per month from June 2025 to October 2026, about 232 hours in all, not billable. How it was worked out:
  - Read all 584 backups in the site's Backups page (2 June 2025 to 24 October 2026).
  - Backups less than 90 minutes apart count as one sitting; each sitting gets its length plus 30 minutes for the work before its first backup. That comes to about 247 hours over 112 sittings.
  - Time already logged on this project (about 15 hours, 24 September to 24 October) was taken off the month it was in, so nothing counts twice.
  - Treat it as a floor: Webflow seems to keep fewer automatic backups as they age, so older months may be short.
  - Each entry says it's an estimate. To redo it with a different gap, delete the nine entries dated the last working day of each month that start "Estimate for".

**Checked how**
- Task list read from boss's database on 24 October 2026 (76 tasks: 28 ticked, 40 open, 8 group headings). Evidence: n/a (documents).
- Time entries: the nine new entries were read back; the project's logged total is now 14,797 minutes (about 247 hours), matching the estimate.

**Built in sessions but not on your list** (for the record; all on staging, most checked by you):
- Scroll magnet on Intro, About, ticker, pricing and portfolio (D-019).
- Menu jumps land in the right place and nothing shows through behind Pricing (D-017).
- Pricing cards line up at every desktop width; pricing anchor fixed.
- Folio hover v3 for the Magic Mouse; the portfolio links work again (the Container class had pointer-events off).
- Testimonial bubbles become a speech bubble that spins into the logo every four seconds (D-018).
- Header phone and email buttons open on hover (desk only); the open-menu restyle (local classes).

**Still open (loose ends from the session notes, not on your list)**
- The bubble fly-in hasn't been tried on Android.
- Open menu: a raspberry close button while it's open; the Estimate button style (a new class, waiting for your OK).
- Tidy: the unused blur rule and the old pixel-transition span rule in the site head.
- Scroll magnet: should a menu click turn it off for a moment? (The Work landing sits right at Portfolio's catch zone.)
- Folio wall: deleting the original, uncompressed images once you're happy (optional).

**Open questions (not blocking)**
- Where the docs live (D-001): here, rather than the separate Webflow docs folder boss's plan describes.
- Whether a tick in your boss list means you're happy with it: the 28 ticked tasks are recorded as accepted on the day you ticked them.
- Success criteria in SCOPE.md.
- Is the old Azure site still what madewithpixels.co.uk serves? (R-059)

**Next useful action:** Phase 1: copy every script and style block from Webflow's custom code into this repo (R-029).

**Handoff:** for the next agent. Read STATUS, then ROADMAP's Phase 1. The site's code is still in Webflow's custom code boxes (site head and footer; home page head and footer; project template). Local working copies from 24 October are not in this repo yet. This folder isn't registered with boss yet (no `boss.repo` key in its git config), and the shared shell on Michael's Mac can't commit here (git needs to delete its lock files, which that shell isn't allowed to do), so leave committing to Michael or a Claude Code session on the Mac.
